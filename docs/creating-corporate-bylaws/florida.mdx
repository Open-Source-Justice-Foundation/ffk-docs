# Florida

Here we'll discuss how to create corporate bylaws for the state of Florida.

## Steps

1. Download the bylaws template.

2. **Name:** State your entity or project name.

3. **Article II: Corporate Purpose**

- _Section 1 “Non-Profit Purpose”_ is very important and contains necessary boilerplate language to qualify for non-profit status with the IRS. Only edit the specified portion.
- _Section 2 “Specific Purpose”_ is where you get to describe your project/non-profit’s mission and scope, and how you would like to accomplish that mission.

4. **Article III** is also extremely important and necessary for qualifying for non-profit status. Do not edit.

5. **Article IV. Membership.** You can create membership tiers that involve dues to raise funds, etc. Or keep it simple as stated in the form.

6. **Article V. Board of Directors.**

- _Section 2 “Number, Tenure, Requirements, and Qualifications.”_
  - The number of required board members and officers will vary by jurisdiction. Check your jurisdiction’s requirements. **Florida requires 3 directors.**
  - Directors term: may be set by statute. Check your specific jurisdiction. But often left to founders to specify.
- _Section 10. “Advisory Council.”_ This feature/section is optional and you may structure it how you wish.

7. **Article VI. Officers.**

- These are set by your jurisdiction’s laws, but we’ve provided the standard officers and their duties here, including President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer.
